With the Shark Tank fever gripping the country,
MDI shares a similar theme. Set to be held in two
rounds, itâ€™s a mock Shark Tank where aspiring
entrepreneurs from around the country pitch
their business models to a panel of investors and
persuade them to invest money in their idea and
the best models would win a prize.
